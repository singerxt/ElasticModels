ElasticModels is a [elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) object modeling tool designed to work in and asynchronous environment.
Builded for [official elasticsearch client library](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js)
Main inspiration was [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) project.

# Overview

### Connecting to Elasticsearch

First, we need to define a connection.

```javascript
const elasticsearch = require('elasticsearch');
const client = new elasticsearch.Client({
  host: 'localhost:9200',
  log: 'trace'
});
const { schema } = require('./lib')(client, {});
```

### Defining a Model

Models are defined through the `schema` interface.

```javascript
const elasticsearch = require('elasticsearch');
const client = new elasticsearch.Client({
  host: 'localhost:9200',
  log: 'trace'
});
const { schema } = require('./lib')(client, {});

const video = schema('video', {
  id: {
    type: String,
  },
  length: {
    type: Number,
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
  },
  descriptionShort: {
    type: String,
    dependencies: ['description'],
    translation: description => description.subString(0, 20) + '...',
  },
  comments: { //Async field
    type: [Object],
    dependencies: ['videoId'],
    translation: videoId => getVideoCommentsForId('id'), // this returning Promise
  }, {
    index: 'video', // required! elastic search index
    type: 'fullEpisode', // required! elasticsearch type
  },
});

```

### Field definition

You have couple options to define field in schema. The most simple is

1. Simple field. This field will looks if `id` exist in data and return value.
```javascript
id: {
  type: String,
}
```

2. Field with string translation. If you need to get value from object type field you can use define field like this.
```javascript
name: {
  type: String,
  translation: 'namespace.description' // You can use dot notation. :-)
}
```

3. Field with string translation with fallback. If you need to get value from field/object and if not exist you want to fallback from another data.
```javascript
description: {
  type: String,
  translation: ['namespace.description, default.description'],
}
```

4. Field with function as translation. If you need to execute code before feeling a field. (Sync)
```javascript
description: {
  type: String,
  dependencies: ['namespace.description, default.description'],
  translate: (desc, defaultDesc, options) => {
    if (desc) {
      return desc;
    } else if(defaultDesc) {
      return defaultDesc;
    } else {
      return 'description not found :('
    }
  }
}
```

5. Field with function as translation. If you need to populate field using another model or you need to pull data from different api
you can return `Promise` from translation function.

```javascript
articles: {
  type: Array,
  dependencies: ['articlesIds'];
  translation: (articlesIds) => articleModel.find({id: articlesIds}).then(docs => docs.getDocuments);
}
```


### Accessing a Model

Once we define model through `schema('ModelName', mySchema)`, we can access it through the same function.

```javascript
const video = schema('video', video);

video.find(query, options).then(documents => documents.getDocuments());
```
you can also `findById`

Important! `.find` method returning `documents` objects to access data you have to resolve `documents.getDocuments()`

### Adding new methods for schema.

You can extend model using `.addMethod(name, func)` method.

```javascript
const video = schema('video', video);

video.addMethod('findOnlyShortVideos', function () {
  return this.find({
    length: '..30000', // find videos what have length less then 30000ms.
  })
});

video.methods.findOnlyShortVideos().then(result => {
  console.log(result); // collection of videos what have length less then 30000ms.
});
```

### Pagination

Model have build in pagination.

```javascript
const video = schema('video', video);

video.find({}, {
  size: 30, // default 25
  from: 0, // default 0
}).then(result => {
  console.log(result); // first 30 objects
});
```



You can also delete extra method using `.deleteMethod('findOnlyShortVideos')`
